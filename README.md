- <b> Risk ID: Use the convention: [Category Code]-[Number] (e.g., FR-01 for Financial, TE-03 for Technical). Codes are listed below. </b>
- <b> Description: Clearly describe the risk, its cause, and its potential effect. </b>
- <b> Category: Select from the dropdown (Financial, Operational, Technical, etc.). </b>
- <b> Likelihood (1-5): How probable is it that this risk will occur? (1=Remote, 5=Certain) </b>
- <b> Impact (1-5): How severe would the consequence be? (1=Negligible, 5=Catastrophic) </b>
- <b> Risk Score: This calculates automatically (Likelihood x Impact). This score prioritizes our efforts. </b>
